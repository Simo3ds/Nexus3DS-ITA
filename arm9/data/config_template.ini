;   y_c = (contrast * whitepoint_c(cct) * x_c + brightness) ^ gamma
; where:
;   * x_c = intensity_c / 255, or x = 1 - (intensity_c / 255),
; depending on whether or not colors are to be inverted

; Color curve adjustment. The 3DS screens are calibrated to a specific

; which attempts to make the most of TN screens present on most 3DSes. At
; the same time, this makes IPS screens kind of look weird without adjustments
; (green-ish hue, cold colors, etc.).
; As it turns out, IPS screens (and only these) have a large enough color
; gamut to undo this curve can be made to behave almost like a proper sRGB display,
; in other words this setting can make IPS screens look like how they do in screen-
; shots: it **significantly** improve how IPS screens look.
; The result is much more mixed for TN screens: it might improve how *some* games
; and *some* software looks, but oftentimes produces a weird red hue.
