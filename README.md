## Installation and Requirements

**Nexus3DS** requires [boot9strap](https://github.com/SciresM/boot9strap) to run.

Once boot9strap has been installed, simply download the latest `boot.firm` file from the [releases page](https://github.com/2b-zipper/Nexus3DS/releases/latest) and place it on the root of your SD card to "install" or upgrade Nexus3DS. Replace any existing `boot.firm` file if necessary.

To build from source, see [Building from source](#building-from-source) below.

## Quick Start

1. Install [boot9strap](https://github.com/SciresM/boot9strap) on your 3DS
2. Build Nexus3DS from source (see [Building from source](#building-from-source))
3. Place the resulting `boot.firm` file on the root of your SD card
4. Configuration menu: Press <kbd>Select</kbd> at boot
5. Rosalina overlay menu: <kbd>L+Down+Select</kbd> (default combo)

**Basic Usage:**
- **Configuration menu**: Press <kbd>Select</kbd> at boot - config stored in `/luma/nexusconfig.ini`
- **Chainloader menu**: Press <kbd>Start</kbd> at boot - payloads go in `/luma/payloads/*.firm`
- **Rosalina menu**: <kbd>L+Down+Select</kbd>

## Building from source

**Prerequisites:**
* git
* [makerom](https://github.com/jakcron/Project_CTR) in `$PATH`
* [firmtool](https://github.com/TuxSH/firmtool) installed
* up-to-date devkitARM and libctru:
  * Install `dkp-pacman`: https://devkitpro.org/wiki/devkitPro_pacman
  * Install 3DS dev tools: `sudo dkp-pacman -S 3ds-dev --needed`

**Build steps:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/2b-zipper/Nexus3DS.git
cd Nexus3DS
make
```

The build produces a single file: `boot.firm`. Copy it to the root of your SD card.

**Note:** For easy SD card file transfer, consider using [ftpd](https://github.com/mtheall/ftpd).

## Known Issues

**Luma3DS (inherited issues):**
* **Cheat engine crashes with some games** (especially Pokémon): Due to a race condition in Nintendo's Kernel11. Use dedicated game plugins as alternative.
* **Games may react to Rosalina button combo**: Change the combo in "Miscellaneous options" → "Save settings" to work around this.

**Nexus3DS specific:**
* No known major issues at this time. Please report any bugs on the [Issues page](https://github.com/2b-zipper/Nexus3DS/issues).
