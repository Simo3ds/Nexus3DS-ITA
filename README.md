## Description

**Nexus3DS** is an enhanced fork of Luma3DS that incorporates numerous community features and improvements. This project builds upon several Luma3DS forks, combining the best features while adding unique enhancements for an improved user experience.

## Limitations
**CTGP7**, does not, and never will, work with Nexus3DS.

The reason why is because there is an anti-cheat which prevent the use of Luma3DS forks. Which is a good thing to make sure the CTGP network is safe from cheaters.

**DO NOT BLAME PABLOMK7 FOR THIS**. We won't ask him to do something about this (such as whitelisting our firm), since he's already working on a ton of things, and adding that also mean taking responsibilities and such, and we don't want to disturb him for this. Thank for your understanding.

**Workaround**: you can use Luma's [Firm Payload Chainloader](https://github.com/LumaTeam/Luma3DS/wiki/Optional-features#firm-payload-chainloader) feature to be able to quickly cholse to boot between Nexus3DS and Luma3DS depending of your needs. The best way would be to use [Fastboot3DS](https://github.com/derrekr/fastboot3DS/releases) allowing you to configure the boot order, buttons and such.

## Enhanced Features

  > **Note:** Configurable via `nexusconfig.ini` only. Using instant reboot may corrupt your SD card

## Installation and Requirements

**Nexus3DS** requires [boot9strap](https://github.com/SciresM/boot9strap) to run.

Once boot9strap has been installed, simply download the latest `boot.firm` file from the [releases page](https://github.com/2b-zipper/Nexus3DS/releases/latest) and place it on the root of your SD card to "install" or upgrade Nexus3DS. Replace any existing `boot.firm` file if necessary.

To build from source, see [Building from source](#building-from-source) below.

## Quick Start

1. Install [boot9strap](https://github.com/SciresM/boot9strap) on your 3DS
2. Build Nexus3DS from source (see [Building from source](#building-from-source))
3. Place the resulting `boot.firm` file on the root of your SD card
4. Configuration menu: Press <kbd>Select</kbd> at boot
5. Rosalina overlay menu: <kbd>L+Down+Select</kbd> (default combo)

**Basic Usage:**
- **Configuration menu**: Press <kbd>Select</kbd> at boot - config stored in `/luma/nexusconfig.ini`
- **Chainloader menu**: Press <kbd>Start</kbd> at boot - payloads go in `/luma/payloads/*.firm`
- **Rosalina menu**: <kbd>L+Down+Select</kbd> (default combo)
- **Home button simulation**: <kbd>R+Select</kbd> (default combo, if enabled in settings)

## Building from source

**Prerequisites:**
* git
* [makerom](https://github.com/jakcron/Project_CTR) in `$PATH`
* [firmtool](https://github.com/TuxSH/firmtool) installed
* up-to-date devkitARM and libctru:
  * Install `dkp-pacman`: https://devkitpro.org/wiki/devkitPro_pacman
  * Install 3DS dev tools: `sudo dkp-pacman -S 3ds-dev --needed`

**Build steps:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/2b-zipper/Nexus3DS.git
cd Nexus3DS
make
```

The build produces a single file: `boot.firm`. Copy it to the root of your SD card.

**Note:** For easy SD card file transfer, consider using [ftpd](https://github.com/mtheall/ftpd).

## Known Issues

**Luma3DS (inherited issues):**
* **Cheat engine crashes with some games** (especially Pokémon): Due to a race condition in Nintendo's Kernel11. Use dedicated game plugins as alternative.
* **Games may react to Rosalina button combo**: Change the combo in "Miscellaneous options" → "Save settings" to work around this.

**Nexus3DS specific:**
* No known major issues at this time. Please report any bugs on the [Issues page](https://github.com/2b-zipper/Nexus3DS/issues).
